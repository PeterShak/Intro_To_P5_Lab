At the start of the process, I was just drawing shapes, a square here, a rectangle there, etc. For my multishape thing, I drew a  golf hole (it was a triangle with a circle under it to create the golf hole look). But I had a realization: why not just make the whole thing about a golf course. So I erased all my work, restarted my sketch, and then went for it.  There wasn't much challenging for me in this process. I labeled my graph paper on interval of 20 so that it would be a big enough scale to have on paper, while not being too big for the paper, and not being too small when it came out in the end. I actuallly ended up finding it more fun than anything; just playing some music, letting the ideas flow, and laying them all out on the page. I had to think about every part (e.x. "what shape should go here?", what coordinate is this shape at?", "how will it look on the page?"). It wasn't just one thing in the code that make more sense, but rather the way everything works makes more sense. The way the shapes fit into one another and how the width/height works. My sketch didn't match exactly with how it came out in the code. However, I was able to figure out what to do in this scenario and revised it on they fly. I am proud of how my project came out. It genuinly looks like a person who is playing golf. Even though it took a while to get the sketch done, around 20 minutes, it was worth it in the end to see a completion of my work.
