### What was challenging for you during this process?
  There wasn't much challenging for me in this process. I actuallly found it more fun than anything; just playing some music, letting the ideas flow, and laying them all out on the page.
### What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
  It wasn't just one thing that make more sense, but rather the way everything works makes more sense. My sketch didn't match exactly with how it came out in the code. However, I was able to figure out what to do in this scenario and revised it on they fly.  
### What are you proud of?
  I am proud of how my project came out and how detailed it was. It took a while to get the sketch done, around 20 minutes, and I think that it was worth it in the end.
